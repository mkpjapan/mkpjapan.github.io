When you get angry, what do you do?  According to the movies, the answer is obvious: yell at the source of anger, maybe punch it, kick it, or throw something. You can do this until you run out of energy or until the problem goes away.  Except the problem really hasn't gone away, has it?

What if there were a different way?

When a situation get you riled up, follow these few simple steps to help get your anger under control:

First, breathe.  Breathe in slowly through your nose, allowing it to fill inside your belly, and then breathe out even more slowly out through your mouth.  In this manner, take five deep belly breaths.

Second, feel.  Where does this feeling of anger reside in your body?  Anger is emotional energy.  Emotional energy can connect to the body in different areas.  Could might be in your stomach; it might be in your chest; it might be in your throat.  It could be anywhere in your body.  Allow yourself to breathe into that location on your body.

Third, think.  Now that you're able to observe the emotion as a curiosity instead of an all encompassing motivator, think about what happened to trigger the anger.  More specifically, what was your part in the situation?  Is there anything that you could have done differently to help prevent this anger from coming up in the first place?

Though these steps are simple, they are powerful in helping you live a more joyful life.

These techniques came from mankind project, whose mission is to heal the world, one man at the time.  Contact https://mkp.org to see if there is a center in your area.

I'm getting mankind project started in Tokyo, and eventually across Japan.  I'm starting with the English speakers, and then we'll find some bilingual people to figure out the best way to translate it into Japanese.

Join me on my mission to help make emotional intelligence as important as the other kind of intelligence.  I need a catchier catchphrase.
