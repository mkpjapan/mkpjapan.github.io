As of September 2019, we have moved into a new location about 5
minutes from Shinjuku station south exit.

Last night we had a productive meeting regarding building a future for
men's work in Tokyo, starting with funding(ยน) for our room.

(ยน) Currently we are not covering the cost of the room 100% with
weekly donations.  We have used funds collected in our old (free)
location to make advance payments for our room reservation, so we
[technically have a slight buffer](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qpCJrAJidECSa-gHgeM0b3z9Ut51zdhTcijH8JiUS2s/edit).

Instead of passing the hat each week, we adopted a monthly payment system.

On the first Tuesday of each month, men who have been sitting with us for a while will be invited to pay in one
of the following three ways:

1. 4000/month   (5000 if the month has 5 Tuesdays)
2. 12,500 for 3 months
3. 25,000 for 6 months


The money will go toward funding the room, and any buffer can be used
to support advertising or future events.  As of this writing the
income/expense sheet is available for viewing at the link below.
