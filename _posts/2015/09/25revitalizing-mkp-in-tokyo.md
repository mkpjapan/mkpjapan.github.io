Three remaining members of Tokyo I-group met last night and expressed
interest in expanding our community which has been in hibernation for
some years.

Our next meeting is scheduled for Friday October 23rd (2015) in Hiroo.
This meeting is only for MKP men, but we will be discussing ways to
expand the group, and probably include new men at future meetings.
