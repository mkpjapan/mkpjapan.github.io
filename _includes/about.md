# About
## Our Organization
<ins>[**The ManKind Project**](https://mankindproject.org/)</ins> supports a global brotherhood of over 1,000 peer-facilitated men's groups serving close to 10,000 men each week. In an MKP men's group, men mentor men through the passages of their lives.

Its flagship training program is called the <ins>[**New Warrior Training Adventure**](https://mankindproject.org/new-warrior-training-adventure/)</ins>. It is not necessary to have any prior training to join the men's circle in Japan.

## Meetings
* The Mankind Project (MKP) Japan meetings are held first Tuesdays of the month at 7PM JST.
* Please read the <ins>[**Agreements**]({{ '/agreements' | prepend: site.baseurl }})</ins> before joining.

## Disclaimer
* We are a peer support group. We do not offer any professional mental or therapeutic services.
* We expect men to work with local community professionals for therapeutic support.
* This group is not a good fit for men who are actively engaged in domestic violence, alcoholism, recreational drug use, or experiencing suicidal ideation.
