# About Tokyo Men's Circle
- Tokyo men’s circle is part of <ins>**[The Mankind Project (MKP)](https://mankindproject.org/)**</ins>. We support men in finding their authentic selves and living their mission in the world.
- MKP Open Men’s Groups are designed as an entry level group. They provide a place for men to experience sharing deeply and personally, of themselves. 
- Some of the men in the Tokyo circle have attended a weekend experiential training called <ins>**[New Warrior Training Adventure](https://mankindproject.org/new-warrior-training-adventure/)**</ins>. The weekend training is normally a prerequisite for sitting in circle. But there are no trainings in Japan, so we are open to new men coming to sit with us.
