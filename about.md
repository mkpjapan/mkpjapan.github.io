# About

## Organization

The ManKind Project supports a global brotherhood of over 1,000 peer-
facilitated men’s groups serving close to 10,000 men each week. In an MKP
men’s group, men mentor men through the passages of their lives.

Its flagship training program is called the [New Warrior Training Adventure](https://mankindproject.org/new-warrior-training-adventure/). It is not necessary to have any prior training to join the men’s
circle in Japan.

## Meetings

The Mankind Project (MKP) Japan meetings are held weekly online on
Tuesdays at 7PM JST.

## AGREEMENTS
Please read the [Agreements](/agreements/) before joining.

 - We expect men to work with local community professionals for therapeutic support.
