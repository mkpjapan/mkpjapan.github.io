I agree to abide by the following:

### Confidentiality

What I say and do here is confidential. I will only share my own experience and personal insights. I will not share another man's words, actions, or identity outside this group. If I wish to mention anything specific a man shared in a previous meeting, I will ask his permission first.

Confidentiality is there to create a sense of safety for all. Confidentiality does not apply in situations of abuse or neglect of children and the elderly and/or threat to harm self or others. If someone's life is in immediate danger, action may be required.

### No recording

No one is to record this meeting in any way.

### Punctuality

I will arrive on time. If I arrive late, I may not be allowed into that day's meeting.

### Ethical Relationships

No solicitations. This is not a business group, dating group or a place to push religious beliefs or political agendas. I will refrain from initiating any personal relationship with other participants that a reasonable person would find unethical or exploitative.

### Non-Violence

I will refrain from violence, whether physical, verbal, emotional, or spiritual. I take responsibility for my words and actions and acknowledge that they impact those around me.

### No Drugs or Alcohol

No drugs or alcohol. I will not attend the group while under the influence of alcohol or recreational drugs. If I break this agreement, I will tell the group and accept the group's choice in handling this to maintain a safe space for the men present.

### Participation

I will speak openly and truthfully in "I" statements (not "you" or "he" statements).

I will not interrupt verbally - but instead, use hand gestures to signify resonance or ask a question. Exceptions are for facilitation, timekeeping or maintaining safety.

I am responsible for taking care of myself. If I have questions, or need something, I will ask.

### Advice & Feedback

I am not here to fix or help others: I serve myself and the group by taking responsibility for anything that comes up for me personally.

I am not here to give or ask for advice. However, I can share relevant experiences from my own life or invite men to share theirs.

I will ask permission before offering feedback. Feedback reflects what I heard/saw/felt in the man who just shared.

### Safety

Safety is everyone's responsibility. Any man may pass at any time or stop or pause any process to maintain safety.

Checking out
I will check out before hanging up. I understand men could be concerned for my welfare, and I will respond if someone contacts me. If I fail to do so or exhibit concerning behaviour, someone from MKP Japan may contact my emergency contact or emergency services.

### Online Etiquette
- I will keep my video and audio connected throughout the meeting.
- I will join from a private location (no roommates/partners present).
- I will mute myself when I'm not talking.
- I will be fully present and not multitask. (e.g. not browsing the web or checking my phone during the meeting.)
- I will refrain from eating during the meeting.
- If my internet drops, I will contact the organisers using the information provided to me.
- I will always pay attention to the screen in case someone is trying to communicate with me.

### Acknowledgement & Commitment
ManKind Project's training, programs, and groups are not a substitute for professional mental health services. I am a man of 18 years of age or older. Mankind Project Japan only welcomes those who agree to be respectful, compassionate and welcoming to all who attend, regardless of their race/ethnicity, ability, socio-economic status, age, religion, or sexual orientation. I understand that I may be removed from the group for being disruptive or not following these agreements.
