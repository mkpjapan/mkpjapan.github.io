# Imagine

Imagine a circle where each man outrageously supports each other in realizing each other's dreams and aspirations.

Imagine a circle where every one listens, not only to what you say, but also to what’s behind or underneath that. Everyone is in tune with your voice, your emotion, your energy – everyone is intent on receiving everything you communicate. This is where everyone listens to hear the very best in you, even when you can’t hear it in yourself.

Imagine a circle which will remind you of your commitments so you can hold yourself accountable and keep you moving forward toward your dreams and goals. A circle of men who remind you of your commitments without judgment when you miss the mark.

Imagine a circle of men who are truly curious about your dreams and aspirations, about what it is that makes you tick, what you value, what you are most passionate about in life - a circle of men who will help clarify your goals and provide tools for action and learning that lead you towards the life you want.

Imagine a circle of men who will absolutely tell you the whole truth about where you are strong and where you sell yourself short - a circle that knows you can handle the challenges of life and knows that’s what you want.

Imagine an experience where you finally break free of those limiting beliefs that sabotage you and where those shadows are noticed for what they are. A circle where this powerful part of you is called forth and developed into a new set of empowering beliefs about yourself.

Imagine a circle where you can experience and develop a new leader within you. A place that is safe to be who you really want to be.

Imagine a circle where every man is given a chance to lead the circle to accomplish a shared vision.

Imagine a circle which is continually growing by learning from each other and from other circles new ways to create a positive impact in the world. A circle that will take ways and traditions from all sources and create its own way, its own traditions - free to find its own truth and way of being in the world.

Imagine a circle which is creating a positive impact in the world through its actions. lf this calls to you, join thousands of men who gather weekly around the world.

We meet weekly on Tuesdays, 7pm Japan Time (GMT +9).  [Register to join us online](/open-mens-group/).
