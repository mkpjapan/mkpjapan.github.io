TL;DR: Confidential listening; just a place to get things off your chest.
Come talk about whatever is important to you, and be heard by men who
care.

Tokyo men's circle is part of [The Mankind Project](https://mankindproject.org/) which supports men in finding their
authentic selves and living their mission in the world.

Some of the men in the Tokyo circle have attended a weekend
experiential training called
[New Warrior Training Adventure](https://mankindproject.org/new-warrior-training-adventure/).
The
weekend training is normally a prerequisite for sitting in circle, but
there are no trainings in Japan, so we are open to new men coming to
sit with us.


Everything spoken in the circle is confidential within the circle.  

If you attend, you will have a chance to speak about any issue that is
challenging in your life, and have a chance to feel some of the
emotions that are (possibly lurking) behind the challenge. All
emotions are welcome; we create a safe space for men to speak.

If you are interested in attending, read and agree to the
[Agreements](/agreements) then send an email.



A co-gender circle is available for women and/or men who have attended
the men's circle for a while.
